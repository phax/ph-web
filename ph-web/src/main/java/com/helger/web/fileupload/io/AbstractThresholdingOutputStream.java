/**
 * An output stream which triggers an event when a specified number of bytes of
 * data have been written to it. The event can be used, for example, to throw an
 * exception if a maximum has been reached, or to switch the underlying stream
 * type when the threshold is exceeded.
 * <p>
 * This class overrides all <code>OutputStream</code> methods. However, these
 * overrides ultimately call the corresponding methods in the underlying output
 * stream implementation.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: This implementation may trigger the event <em>before</em> the threshold
 * is actually reached, since it triggers when a pending write operation would
 * cause the threshold to be exceeded.
